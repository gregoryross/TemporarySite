										<h3>Atomistic simulations for drug discovery</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Much of my research resolves around atomistic simulations of biomolecules, by
										which I mean proteins, drugs, solvent (e.g. water) and other small molecules
										that are relevant for molecular biology. The simulations use models of the
										forces between atoms to quantitatively predict things that those in drug
										discovery care about, such as the binding affinities between of a set of drug
										candidates and a protein that is implicated in a disease. Being atomistic in
										resolution, the simulations give us an unprecedented level of detail on the
										systems we study. So, in addition to using simulations for quantitative
										predictions, we can use them to generate hypotheses to address questions like
										‘how does this particular drug bind?’ and ‘how does this particular protein
										function?’.
									</p>
									<p>
										Despite being very simplified models of the atomistic world, the simulations are
										very complex and time intensive. For a typically sized protein immersed in
										water, the simulations have to evaluate the forces between tens of thousands of
										atoms over hundreds of thousands of iterations. Depending on the system and the
										sort of questions one is trying to answer, simulations can take days to months.
										Despite the increasing power of computer processors and smarter use of hardware,
										sampling the important states of the biomolecules still remains a challenge.
										Broadly speaking, the two main problems my field grapples with are to address
										are to 1) improve the accuracy of the models of the forces, and 2) improve the
										thoroughness of the sampling. A lot of my research has been on the latter.
									</p>
									<p>
										I am also very keen on reducing the barriers to using atomistic simulations.
										They require expertise to set-up, run, and analyse. One large barrier is the
										complexity of the software we use, a problem that is compounded in academic
										research as software is frequently augmented additional functionality. This in
										turn raises issues of the sustainability of the software itself. I strive to
										make all my software easy to use, free, open-source, and written in an
										interpretable way.
