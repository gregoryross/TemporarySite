                            and to develop methods that help medicinal chemists decide

										<h3>Atomistic simulations for drug discovery</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Much of my research revolves around atomistic simulations of biomolecules, and by
										'biomolecules', I mean proteins, drugs, solvent (e.g. water) and other small molecules
										that are of biological interest. The simulations model the forces between atoms
										to predict configurations and dynamical processes, which in turn can be used to
										estimate quantities can that verified (or falsified) experimentally. Being
										atomistic in resolution, the simulations give us an unprecedented level of detail on the
										systems in question, so we can use them to generate hypotheses to address questions like
										‘how does this particular drug bind?’ and ‘how does this particular protein
										function?’.
									</p>
									<p>
										Despite being very simplified models of the atomistic world, the simulations are
										very complex and time intensive. For a typically sized protein immersed in
										water, the simulations have to evaluate the forces between tens of thousands of
										atoms over hundreds of thousands of iterations. Depending on the system and the
										sort of questions one is trying to answer, simulations can take days to months.
										Despite the increasing power of computer processors and smarter use of hardware,
										sampling the important states of the biomolecules still remains a challenge.
										Broadly speaking, the two main problems my field grapples with are 1) improving
										the accuracy of the modelled atomistic forces, and 2) improving the
										thoroughness of the sampling. A lot of my research has been on the latter,
										particular with enhancing the sampling of water in buried protein cavities (for
										instance, see <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5b07940">this paper</a>).
									</p>
									<p>
										I am also very keen on reducing the barriers to using atomistic simulations.
										They require expertise to set-up, run, and analyse. One large barrier is the
										complexity of the software we use, a problem that is compounded in academic
										research due to the frequent augmentations and modifications that are made to
										the software as the science progresses. This in
										turn raises issues of the sustainability of the software itself. I strive to
										make all my software easy to use, free, open-source, and written in an
										interpretable way. I'm currently a developer for
										<a href="http://www.essexgroup.soton.ac.uk/ProtoMS">ProtoMS</a> and work on
										tools for <a href="http://openmm.org">OpenMM</a>. Another barrier to using
										atomistic simulations is knowing how make reliable inferences from the large and
										complex data that is produced. It is important to ask the
										the <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct4004228">right questions</a>
										from the data, and have the best tools to address them. As a result, I'm really
										interested in statistics (with a Bayesian flavour) and machine learning.
